OpenCV based tracking software that allows control of computer without touching it

## Features
 - Allows 4 controls - by actions UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT
 - For example: Volume up, Volume Down, Next song, Prev song (current config)
 
## Next steps
 - Better gesture detection: http://depts.washington.edu/madlab/proj/dollar/index.html
 - Currently works by detecting color ranges, and detecting biggest contour
 - Needs a solid color patch to work the best
 - Build better detection algorithm for harder to see targets
 - Allow mouse control
